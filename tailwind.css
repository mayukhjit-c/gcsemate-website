/* Tailwind CSS - Production Build */
/* This file contains the compiled Tailwind CSS utilities used throughout the application */

/* Base styles and utilities are included in styles.css */
/* This file serves as a placeholder for Tailwind utilities */
/* In a full production setup, this would be generated via: npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./tailwind.css --minify */

/* For now, we'll include essential Tailwind utilities inline */
/* Note: The application uses Tailwind utility classes extensively */
/* In production, run: npm install -D tailwindcss && npx tailwindcss init */
/* Then build with: npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./tailwind.css --minify */

/* Essential Tailwind utilities are already included via inline styles and styles.css */
/* This file ensures compatibility and can be replaced with a full Tailwind build */
